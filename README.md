# California Covid-19 Case Tracker


## Project Description

Case Tracker designed to visualize California state Covid-19 new cases and deaths. The program implemented using Bokeh library and run with Bokeh server. There are 2 charts being shown:
- Line chart to show daily new cases/deaths of Covid-19 in California state
- Pie chart to show total cases/deaths in proportion to ethnicity/race.




## Files added

1. requirements.txt contain environment requirement that would create separate environment under "env" folder.

2. case_tracker.py contain main visualization script that would visualize all charts using Bokeh.

3. Dockerfile contain docker setting that would create docker image in local machine.

4. NonlocalDockerfile contain docker setting that would create docker image in non local machine such as play-with-docker labs site.

5. Existing data file used for Line Chart (new cases or deaths in California State) : cdph-state-totals.csv

6. Existing data file used for Pie Chart (total cases/deaths according to ethnicity) : cdph-race-ethnicity.csv




## Preparing Environment and Running Project

1. Open command line/power shell and do git clone by running:

```
git clone https://github.com/nandrian-usc/california-coronavirus-data.git
```

and get inside california-coronavirus-data folder:

```
cd california-coronavirus-data
```


2. If not installed yet, do pip installation of virtualenv

```
pip install virtualenv
```

3. Make new environment named "env" by running in command line:

```
python -m venv env
```

4. Activate environment by running:

```
.\env\Script\activate
```

5. Install dependencies (numpy, pandas, bokeh) with two ways:

a. by manually running in order:

```
pip install numpy
```

```
pip install pandas
```

```
pip install bokeh
```

b. Or by using requirement.txt from git clone, run:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

6. Run visualization script by executing: 

```
bokeh serve --show .\case_tracker.py
```

Wait until page is opened in browser or open <a href="http://localhost:5006/case_tracker">http://localhost:5006/case_tracker</a>

7. Browse data in the charts by selecting from dropdown and date picker.

8. Shutdown bokeh server when finished by pressing Ctrl+C in terminal. Deactivate "env" environment when finished

```
deactivate
``` 





## Run Project using Docker

There are two options to build and run Dockerfile which are running it in local computer or running it in play-with-docker.

### a. Local Computer

Build in local computer and run the image will run the application bokeh server right from start so that user can just open the URL link (mentioned in powershell, ex: http://localhost:5006/case_tracker) in the browser.

i. Make sure you have docker service installed and running in your local computer. For example in this project, Docker Desktop was already running in Windows machine. Open windows PowerShell and start typing below commands.

ii. git clone github repository by running: 

```
git clone https://github.com/nandrian-usc/california-coronavirus-data.git
```

iii. Go into california-coronavirus-data folder:

```
cd california-coronavirus-data
```

iv. Build docker image using Dockerfile with prefered image name, in this case "californiacovidcasetracker"

```
docker build . -t californiacovidcasetracker
```

v. Check that image was successfully created, run:
 
```
docker images -a
``` 

See that image californiacovidcasetracker is among the result.

vi. Run docker image in container by executing:

```
docker run --rm -it -d -p 5006:5006/tcp californiacovidcasetracker:latest
```

vii. Open the Case Tracker site by opening in browser <a href="http://localhost:5006/case_tracker">http://localhost:5006/case_tracker</a>



### b. Play-With-Docker
Different docker file (named NonlocalDockerfile) was used to build image outside local Computer such as play-with-docker lab. This is because after running the created docker image, it won't run the bokeh server yet because there'll be extra configuration (which is --allow-websocket-origin) needed for networking access that should be executed in container's command line along with bokeh server command.

i. Open play-with-docker site at <a href="https://labs.play-with-docker.com/">here</a> and click Start.

ii. git clone github repository by running: 

```
git clone https://github.com/nandrian-usc/california-coronavirus-data.git
```

iii. Go into california-coronavirus-data folder:

```
cd california-coronavirus-data
```

iv. Build docker image using Dockerfile with prefered image name, in this case "californiacovidcasetracker"

```
docker build -t californiacovidcasetracker -f NonlocalDockerfile .
```

v. Check that image was successfully created, run:
 
```
docker images -a
``` 

See that image californiacovidcasetracker is among the result.

vi. Run docker image in container by executing:

```
docker run --rm -it -d -p 5006:5006/tcp californiacovidcasetracker:latest
```

vii. Before running the application, you will need information on "container name" and "playwithdocker_network_address" which can be known by:

- <container_name> : run "docker ps" command and look for the name under header NAMES, example: "gracious_ardinghelli"

- <playwithdocker_network_address> : copy ssh link under SSH field; removed "ssh " text; replace "@" text with "-5006." where 5006 is the port. 

Example from ssh copy text "ssh ip172-18-0-33-buh1nlpqckh000enmm7g@direct.labs.play-with-docker.com" then should be changed into "ip172-18-0-33-buh1nlpqckh000enmm7g-5006.direct.labs.play-with-docker.com"

viii. Execute:

```
docker exec -it <container name> bokeh serve --show ./case_tracker.py --allow-websocket-origin=<playwithdocker_network_address>
```

with first changing <container_name> and <playwithdocker_network_address> to use our respective values from step vii, or by using our previous example then the command would be:

```
docker exec -it gracious_ardinghelli bokeh serve --show ./case_tracker.py --allow-websocket-origin=ip172-18-0-33-buh1nlpqckh000enmm7g-5006.direct.labs.play-with-docker.com
```

ix. Open the Case Tracker site by clicking port link next to Open Port button (in this case: "5006")


### Misc:

i. "REPOSITORY" and "IMAGE_ID" used below can be known by executing: 

```
docker images -a
``` 

From result see under header REPOSITORY and IMAGE_ID. 

"NAMES" below can be known by executing 

```
docker ps
```

From result see under NAMES header.

ii. Stop all running containers by executing:

``` 
docker stop $(docker ps -aq)
```

or to just stop one container by executing:

``` 
docker stop <NAMES>
```

example:

```
docker stop c336566b44e3
```

iii. Save image into offline tar file by executing:

```
docker save -o <output_path> <REPOSITORY>
```

example: 

```
docker save -o D:\californiacovidcasetracker.tar californiacovidcasetracker
```

iv. Load image from offline image file by executing:

```
docker load -i <input_path> 
```

example:

```
docker load -i D:\californiacovidcasetracker.tar
```

v. Delete image by executing: 

```
docker rmi <IMAGE_ID>
```

example:

```
docker rmi b6cefbebfaaa
```

vii. See images which is dangling:

```
docker images -f dangling=true
```

## About the data

These files come from a continual Times survey of California's 58 county health agencies and three city agencies. Updated numbers are published throughout the day at [latimes.com/coronavirustracker](https://www.latimes.com/projects/california-coronavirus-cases-tracking-outbreak/). This repository will periodically update with an extract of that data.

The figures are typically ahead of the totals compiled by California's Department of Public Health. By polling local agencies, The Times database also gathers some information not provided by the state. The system has [won praise](https://twitter.com/palewire/status/1243329930877788160) from public health officials, who do not dispute its method of data collection.

The tallies here are mostly limited to residents of California, the standard method used to count patients by the stateâ€™s health authorities. Those totals do not include people from other states who are quarantined in California, such as the passengers and crew of the Grand Princess cruise ship that docked in Oakland.

## Data dictionary

### [latimes-agency-totals.csv](./latimes-agency-totals.csv)

The total cases and deaths logged by local public health agencies each day. Each row contains the cumulative totals reported by a single agency as of that date.

Most counties have only one agency except for Alameda and Los Angeles counties, where some cities run independent health departments. In Alameda County, the city of Berkeley is managed independently. In Los Angeles County, Pasadena and Long Beach are managed independently. These cities' totals are broken out into separate rows. In order to calculate county-level totals, you must aggregate them together using the `county` field.

### [latimes-place-totals.csv](./latimes-place-totals.csv)

Some counties, primarily in Southern California, break out the location of cases within their service area. The Times is gathering and consolidating these lists. Each row contains cumulative case totals reported in that area as of that date.

The following counties currently do not report cases by locality: Alpine, Colusa, Glenn, Inyo, Lake, Lassen, Mariposa, Modoc, San Benito, Sierra, Tehama and Tuolumne.

Some counties provide data by region. The locations provided by Los Angeles County correspond to the public health department's official "Countywide Statistical Areas". Locations in other counties are manually geocoded by The Times. San Francisco and Imperial counties provide data at the ZIP Code level.

Be aware that some counties have shifted the place names used over time.

In some circumstances the true total of cases is obscured. Los Angeles and Orange counties decline to provide the precise number of cases in areas with low populations and instead provide a potential range. The lowest number in the range is entered into the record in the `confirmed_cases` field and an accompanying `note` includes the set of possible values.

### [cdph-state-totals.csv](./cdph-state-totals.csv)

Totals published by the California Department of Public Health in [its daily press releases](https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/OPA/Pages/New-Release-2020.aspx). Each row contains all numbers included in that day's release.

This file includes cases and deaths, the age of victims, transmission types, tests and hospitalizations. The state has stopped supplying some fields and began supplying some others over time. Deprecated fields have been maintained in this file and are noted below.

Due to bureaucratic lags, the state's totals for cases and deaths arrive slower than The Times numbers, which are generated by surveying local agencies. The state's methods for collecting testing data have struggled with [errors](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-04-04/gavin-newsom-california-coronavirus-testing-task-force) and [delays](https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2020-03-30/its-taking-up-to-eight-days-to-get-coronavirus-tests-results-heres-why).

Some dates are missing because the state did not publish a press release for that day.

### [cdph-nursing-home-county-totals.csv](./cdph-nursing-home-county-totals.csv)

The total number of cases and deaths in skilled-nursing facilities, residential care facilities for the elderly and adult residential facilities aggregated by county.

These numbers are calculated by The Times using the facilities lists above. The state chooses not to provide precise numbers at facilities with fewer than 10 cases. When totaling by county, The Times substitutes the minimum value of one. The result is that the tallies are likely an undercount and should be considered the minimum possible value.
